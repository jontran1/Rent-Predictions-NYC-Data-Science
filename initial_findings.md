### Part 1:

 We are using linear regression model to obtain our mean square error. We used heat map to find the best features for the prediction model. We selected best correlated features with rent. The features that were mostly correlated were bathroom, square footage, bin, bbl, has_doormen and floor_count and least correlated with one another as possible. We eliminated bedroom because we want to prevent collinearity As much as possible. It was eliminated because it was correlated than bathroom. The mean squared error results in 3403664.674.
Using the simple Linear Regression Equation we are using
-  Y = A + B * X
-  Y - Rent Prediction
-  X - Bathroom vs Square Footage vs Bin vs bbl vs has_doormen 
-  A and B are both estimated by the regression.

 - These are our trained weights in our model which gave us the lowest residual square errors. The model’s final weights are listed above, along with the intercept. Jon’s terminology: Sum of squared errors
 
 #####Now we  calculate the mean squared error 
We are looking for residuals in the data between different data features with the already predicted rent.

 - 1/n  (1….12000) different values of (observed Vals - predicted Vals(dataset)) All generated by the mean squared error function.
###Reasoning
The number of bathrooms may be very relative to the (Square Footage)size of the place of rent. This is why we think there is such similar positive correlation(0.56 to 0.6) to rent. BIN(Building Identification Number negative correlation of -0.3 is negatively correlated with rent) gives us a rough estimate to borough or place which gives a relative area to where the place may be more affluent and other factors in the nearby region of the building. (if BBL stands of Borough, Building and lot, this would give us a similar correlation to BIN(negative correlation -0.31) also based on the same types of factors as BIN. Has_doorman has the least positive correlation out of the list of features we’ve selected but still relevant as we think it pertains to perhaps the location having a premium service.

 ###Part 2:
To improve our prediction, we plan to incorporate data about racial and social constitution of the area. There is a common trend of gentrification in many New York City neighborhoods. As wealthier social and racial classes move into an area, they are likely willing to pay more for rent than the people living in that area previously, thus driving up the rent. In consequence to this, the previous occupants of a neighborhood wouldn’t be able to keep up with this increased cost, and be forced to move out. We think that this would make data pertaining to race and class distribution helpful in predicting rent prices. 
  
We also plan to evaluate all of our features and determine which ones yield the best models. On top of this, we will consider other models altogether to build off of, such as a k nearest neighbors model. We hope that by exploring other models, we may find one which will best suit our data.
