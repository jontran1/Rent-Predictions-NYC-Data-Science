### Project Findings
#### Do you show evidence of making meaningful progress beyond the modeling steps made in lecture 5?
Our original model was a linear regression model. Which gave us decent results of mse around 3 million, But we realize other models may perform better.
Use multiple models, heatmaps, and charts to make progress towards lowering the mse. 
#### Have you applied techniques and strategies demonstrated over the course of the semester? 
- Test different models
- Filled null values
- Cleaned the data

New data set gave us a lower mse for linear regression
New data set gave us a lower mse for polynomial regression
However, the new data set increased our mse for random forest by 200k, but was still the lowest mse out of all the models.
Filling the null values lowered the mse for linear regression but increased it for all over models. However random forest model still is the lowest.
