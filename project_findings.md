### Project Findings
Do you show evidence of making meaningful progress beyond the modeling steps made in lecture 5?
Our original model was a linear regression model. Which gave us decent results of mse around 3 million, But we realize other models may perform better.
Use multiple models, heatmaps, and charts to make progress towards lowering the mse.
